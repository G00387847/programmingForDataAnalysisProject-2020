# programmingForDataAnalysisProject-2020


# Introduction
The study of this project will be focus on how to use simulation to create a data for a real-world phenomenon. By simulation we mean, an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time.[1]

Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education[2], and video games. Often, computer experiments are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems[2] or human systems to gain insight into their functioning,[3] as in economics. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist. wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation

The problem solving will base on how to generate a dataset that is close enough for the purpose to solve the real-world phenomenon.

# Problem Statement

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish â€“ you might pick one that is of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python. We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose. Specifically, in this project you should:

Lunch of Healthy Ireland 2021
This is the seventh time the Healthy Ireland Survey will be conducted and adds to the data collected in the previous surveys from 2015 - 2020. It is envisaged that a representative sample of approximately 7,400 people, aged 15 and older, living in Ireland will be interviewed between October 2020 and June 2021.

The project will base its focus research and investigation

- Physical Activity
- Smoking
- Height
-Weight and BMI
using 2019 healthy Ireland summary report

# Packages use for the Project

The following packages were used to run statistical analysis and draw grpahs for this project.

Python https://www.python.org/downloads/

Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.

Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.

Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations and narriative text
