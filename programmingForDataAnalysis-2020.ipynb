    "The study of this project will be focus on how to use simulation to create a data  for a real-world phenomenon.\n",
    "By simulation we mean, an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system that represents its operation over time.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education[2], and video games. Often, computer experiments are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems[2] or human systems to gain insight into their functioning,[3] as in economics. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.  wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation\n",

    "of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data\n",
    "related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.\n",
    "We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.\n",
